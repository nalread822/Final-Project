                <h2>Hi, I'm Nicole...</h2>
                <p class="leading">Mom, wife, career woman – and so much more. If you had asked me four years ago to describe myself, I wouldn't have had this list: lover of coffee shop music, sobriety, spirituality, playing, being in nature and creative projects. Back then, life was a blur of auto-pilot, numbing big emotions with alcohol, and a deep, unsettling feeling of being completely lost. My relationship with food was a mess too – a constant battle, another way to cope and control. I was desperate for change. Sound familiar?<br><br>That change came in the form of a coach, therapist, dietician, and my family’s support - all who helped me see a whole new path for myself, a chance at a truly meaningful life. And now, I'm here. Not just to share my story, but to light the way for you to discover yours. This journey is about getting to know yourself, honoring the person you are, and stepping into the fullness of who you are meant to be.

                    <p class="leading">This before and after represents more than just a physical transformation; it's a reflection of an internal shift. I understand the demand for immediate change, whether it's in your health, career, or any area of your life, really. This visual might be a powerful motivator, but I want to emphasize that this kind of change is a journey, not a destination. Each step you take, each moment you dedicate to your ideal life, brings you closer to your goals.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While I was focused on healing, on self-love, and on nurturing my well-being, my body responded, changing with every conscious choice. It's truly incredible what can happen when we release the obsession with external validation—the numbers on the scale, the reflection in the mirror, the opinions of others—and instead, live for ourselves. These transformations, both internal and external, happen in tandem. The more you prioritize self-care, the more profound the changes will be. The lifestyle you crave is in arms reach, choose it, every day, step by step.</p>
                    <br><p>I’ve done the work - let me guide you with the very principles that helped me. Let’s explore this journey together! </p>
